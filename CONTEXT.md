# Context

## Current State
UI polish pass in progress. Box Profile page features complete and audited. Box Profile visual polish pass is next, then page-by-page polish starting with Header/Nav. All major business decisions from Cam call (April 13, 2026) and follow-up conversation (April 20, 2026) are locked and documented below.

## What's Been Decided and Locked
- **Scope:** Baseball, Football, Basketball, Hockey, Soccer at launch. All sports need full database population for beta — not just baseball. No TCG categories.
- **Data coverage:** Full profiles (checklist, pull rates, EV, ROI, card pricing) for boxes 2018-present. Legacy boxes (1995-2017) get box profiles without EV/ROI but keep checklist, card pricing, top chases, and pull rates where available.
- **Card-level pricing required:** Every card in a checklist needs a current market value. This is what makes EV and ROI calculations work. Not just top chases — the full checklist priced out.
- **EV and ROI confirmed:** Stays in the product. This is the core differentiator vs. Waxstat and everyone else.
- **Core value prop:** "When I buy a box, what cards can I get, how much are they worth, and what's the best box for my budget and goals?"
- **Tagline:** "Think inside the box."
- **Revenue model — LOCKED:** Fully paid box profiles. Free browsing experience (homepage, browse page, search, filtering, scrolling through box sets) on web only. Paywall triggers when user clicks into a box profile page. Conversion funnel: visit site → scroll and look up boxes → click on box profile → hit paywall → pay for deeper analysis.
- **Data sources:** Manufacturer pull rates + eBay sold listings only.
- **Tech stack:** React + Vite frontend on Vercel, PostgreSQL on Supabase, Python or Node.js backend, Claude API for photo scan and trend summary features.
- **Database schema:** 13 tables, 2 views. Complete and finalized — do not rebuild. Schema amendments needed during database phase: add `circulation_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'unknown'` to `cards` table; add `parent_set_id INT REFERENCES box_sets(id)` to `box_sets` table for format switcher; add `distributors` and `distributor_listings` tables for affiliate/Buy Now system.
- **Business structure:** 50/50 split with Cam Gibson. Zach handles all technical work. Cam handles business development, distribution, and capital.
- **Strategy:** Leaning build-to-run (shift from original build-to-sell framing). Not finalized but mindset is long-term operation.
- **Distribution:** Starts with local card stores, scales from there. Specifics TBD during beta when Cam begins outreach.
- **Native app (iOS) — HARD REQUIREMENT:** The DIR iOS app is authentication only. There is no free tier, no in-app signup flow, and no in-app purchase system. All user acquisition and payment happens exclusively on the web at DIRapp.com through Stripe. The app opens to a login screen with a single line directing users without credentials to the website. Once authenticated, users have full premium access. Without credentials the app has no usable functionality. This is an intentional architectural decision to avoid Apple's in-app purchase requirements and their associated revenue cut. It is not to be changed without a deliberate architectural review. The only free-facing feature in the entire product is the ability to browse card boxes by year — this exists on the web only, not in the app.
- **React Native:** React Native build needed for pitch demos. Build web app first, port to native once features are solid. PWA as a possible interim step — pending partner discussion.
- **Filtering system:** Filters are data-driven (populated from database), not hardcoded. Changing filter options later is a data task, not a code rebuild. Filter combinations cascade — sport + manufacturer + year + format all work together.
- **Routing:** React Router. All routes defined in App.jsx. Routes: `/` (homepage), `/browse` (browse page with filters), `/box/:slug` (box profile), `/about`, `/news`, `/contact`, `/help`, `/signin`, `/signup`.
- **Browse page architecture:** Dedicated browse page at `/browse` with StockX-style layout. Left sidebar has filter sections (Sport → Manufacturer → Year → Format, in that order). Right side shows results grid of BoxSetCard components. Clicking any card routes to `/box/:slug`.
- **Filter URL structure:** Filters are passed as URL query parameters. Example: `/browse?sport=baseball&manufacturer=topps&year=2024&format=hobby`. Header nav links route to `/browse` with appropriate query params applied. Every filter combination produces a unique, shareable URL.
- **Cascading filter logic:** Selecting a filter narrows the options in downstream filters. Example: selecting "Baseball" limits manufacturers to only those with baseball products. Prevents dead-end filter combinations with zero results.
- **Landing pages:** About, News, Contact, Help, Sign In, Sign Up. Dummy content for now. These do NOT need to be locked down before database/backend work — they're independent static pages that can be updated any time.
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth (planned). Sign In and Sign Up pages are built as visual templates. Will be wired to Supabase when auth is implemented. Users table in schema includes email, display_name, password_hash, plan columns. Email opt-in checkbox on sign-up form (add `email_opt_in` boolean to users table during auth implementation).
- **Buy Now / affiliate system — LOCKED:** Price comparison with multiple distributors on box profile pages. Starts with 1-2 distributors, grows over time. Boxes without distributor listings fall back to "Find on eBay" affiliate link. System gets designed and built but launches empty — populated when Cam has distributor partnerships (during beta). No distributor outreach until app is ready. New database tables needed: `distributors` and `distributor_listings`. Buy Now button is built as a UI placeholder on the box profile page — wired to distributor_listings table during database phase.
- **eBay Partner Network:** Free to join, 1-4% commission (collectibles on the higher end at 3-4%), 24-hour cookie window. Sign up when real data is live on the site (Phase 10-12 timeframe) — signing up with dummy data risks rejection.
- **Data entry — LOCKED:** Zach handles all data entry during beta (5-10 hrs/week). No data engineer hire until revenue or investors. Pipeline needs to be founder-operable. AI-assisted workflow: paste raw data from sources into Claude (or Cowork) for structuring, output to spreadsheets matching database schema, bulk import when database is live. Spreadsheet templates created (drafts) — will be finalized when Zach brings real box data to cross-reference against schema.
- **Data entry sources by sport:**
  - Baseball: Beckett, Cardboard Connection, Topps, Baseballcardpedia
  - Football: TCDB (tcdb.com) — Panini exclusive until 2025, Topps post-2025
  - Basketball: TCDB — Panini exclusive license
  - Hockey: TCDB — Upper Deck exclusive license
  - Soccer: TCDB — Panini and Topps
  - Pull rates (all sports): Cross-reference Beckett, Cardboard Connection, Chasing Majors, and Checklist Insider. TCDB does not publish pull rates. Chasing Majors and Checklist Insider provide format-level odds (Hobby vs Jumbo vs Blaster etc).
- **Legacy boxes idea (on the shelf):** Separate "Legacy Boxes" header tab showing a filtered list of pre-2018 boxes available for purchase through affiliate partners. Only populated when distributor partnerships exist. May or may not be built — not on the roadmap, just documented as a future idea.
- **Budget:** $5k max for professional code audits (covers all three planned audits). No data engineer hire until revenue.
- **Timeline:** No hard launch date. Working diligently but not rushing. No corners cut.
- **Images strategy — LOCKED:** Don't let images block data entry. Enter checklist/pricing/pull rate data first, leave image_url blank. Primary image source is distributor product feeds (Dave & Adam's, Blowout Cards, Steel City, etc.) — clean, standardized, high-res box art pulled automatically as a byproduct of price scraping, same method Waxstat uses for their 27k+ box library. eBay API (Phase 13) is the fallback for boxes no distributor carries. Manufacturer sites are a tertiary source. Placeholder images acceptable for beta. Images are never manually sourced.
- **Grails tab — LOCKED:** Box profile page has two separate tabs for high-value cards. Top Chases shows cards with `print_run` > 10 or no print run (base autos, standard parallels, refractors — realistically pullable cards that drive EV/ROI math). Grails tab shows cards with `print_run` ≤ 10, including all 1/1s and Superfractors. The /10 cutoff is a hard product decision, not a preference. Grails are excluded from EV and ROI calculations entirely — their pull probability is effectively zero for any individual buyer and including them would inflate EV misleadingly. Grails display a `circulation_status` badge: `Unknown`, `In Circulation`, or `Pulled/Sold`. Status defaults to `Unknown` at data entry and is updated when reliable data exists. The `cards` table requires a `circulation_status` column (values: `unknown`, `in_circulation`, `pulled_sold` — default `unknown`).
- **Color scheme — LOCKED:** Dark mode. Background #111214, surfaces #1e1f24, hero sections #18191d, borders #2a2a2e, primary text #f0f0f0, secondary text #777777, accent #7c6fff, accent background #2a2560, accent text #a89fff. Positive financial indicators (ROI, positive price movement) use #16a34a (green) via `--color-positive` — intentional, must not be changed to purple. Price trend chart line is #16a34a. All colors are CSS variables in index.css. May change post-beta based on user feedback — CSS variables make this a one-file change.
- **Format switcher — LOCKED:** Box profile page has a tab row at the top to switch between available formats (Hobby, Jumbo, Blaster, Mega, Retail). Switching format updates MSRP, pull rates, EV, and ROI. Checklist cards are the same across formats — only odds and pricing change. URL updates via query parameter (e.g. `/box/2024-topps-chrome-baseball?format=hobby`). Only formats that actually exist for a set are shown. Requires `parent_set_id INT REFERENCES box_sets(id)` on `box_sets` table to group formats together. Data sources for format-level odds: Cardboard Connection, Chasing Majors, Checklist Insider. Built with dummy data during UI polish pass — wire to real data during database phase.
- **Price trend charts — LOCKED:** Two charts on box profile page. (1) Sealed box price trend in hero section — market price of the sealed box over time. (2) Card Value Trend by tier — average sale price of the top 10 eBay sold listings per tier per time period, with toggle tabs: Base, Rookies, Autos, Patch Autos. Data sourced from `price_history` table filtered by tier and `source = 'ebay'`. Both charts use #16a34a (green) for the trend line. Built with dummy data during UI polish pass — wire to real data during database phase.
- **Checklist expand/collapse — LOCKED:** Tiers are collapsed by default — no cards visible until the tier header is clicked. Clicking the tier header toggles it open or closed (accordion pattern). When open: search bar appears at top, first 5 cards are shown, "Show more" button appears at the bottom if the tier has more than 5 cards. "Show more" reveals the complete remaining card list — no secondary limit. Tiers display in descending value order: Premium Hits first, Base last. Sort handled by `sortTiersByValue` in `checklistUtils.js`. Search resets when a tier is collapsed.
- **Card search within checklist tiers — LOCKED:** Each expanded tier has a lightweight search input at the top that filters cards in real time as the user types. Searches player name and card number. Search input only appears when the tier is expanded. Scoped to the current box only — global card search is a separate post-launch feature. Works on both web and mobile.
- **Pull rates display — LOCKED:** Pull rate categories shown on box profile page: Base, Refractor, Rookie Refractor, Numbered, Base Auto, Refractor Auto, Patch Auto, Case Hit, Auto Relic, Relic. Grid displays 4 columns on desktop, 2 columns on mobile. Boxes sized to fit cleanly at all screen widths.
- **Box profile page section order — LOCKED:** Hero (format switcher + stats + Buy Now) → Top Chases / Grails → Pull Rates → Price Trends → Card Value Trends → Full Checklist.
- **Checklist tier display order — LOCKED:** Tiers display in descending value order: Premium Hits first, Base & Rookies last. Current order: (1) Premium Hits, (2) Autographs, (3) Refractors, (4) Inserts & Short Prints, (5) Base & Rookies. Controlled by `sortTiersByValue` in `checklistUtils.js` which sorts descending by tier number. NOTE: This is a workaround — the database schema currently numbers tiers with 1 = Base and 5 = Premium Hits (inverted). During database phase the schema tier numbers will be flipped and `sortTiersByValue` updated to sort ascending.
- **Coming soon / upcoming releases — POST-LAUNCH:** A "Coming Soon" section on the homepage showing upcoming box releases with countdown timers. No new schema needed — uses existing `release_date` and `is_active` columns on `box_sets`. Unreleased boxes entered with `is_active = FALSE` and a future `release_date`. On release day `is_active` flips to `TRUE` automatically. Zach will build a personal notification tool to alert him when new boxes are announced. Post-launch only — not in beta scope.

## Full Roadmap
1. ~~Codebase audit~~ ✅
2. ~~Routing and filtering system~~ ✅
3. ~~Landing pages~~ ✅
4. ~~Deploy to Vercel~~ ✅
5. ~~Dark mode color scheme~~ ✅
6. UI polish pass ← CURRENT
   - Box Profile visual polish pass ← NEXT
   - Then page-by-page polish + code audit (end each session with audit before committing):
     - Header/Nav
     - Homepage (add Coming Soon placeholder section)
     - Browse
     - About
     - News
     - Help
     - Contact
     - Sign In
     - Sign Up
7. Auth system (Supabase) — revenue model locked as fully paid box profiles
8. Pro audit #1 (senior React dev — is the frontend and auth foundation solid? ~3-5 hours at $50-150/hr = $150-750)
9. Database setup and backend API (add `circulation_status` and `parent_set_id` to schema; add `distributors` and `distributor_listings` tables)
10. Connect frontend to real data
11. Admin panel for data entry
12. eBay API proof of concept — small targeted test after admin panel is live. Write a script that takes a card name, hits the eBay sold listings endpoint, and returns the last 10 sales with an average price. Use it to price out one test box set (2024 Topps Chrome Baseball). Confirms the API works before building the full pipeline.
13. Pull rate scraper test — target Cardboard Connection for 2024 Topps Chrome Baseball. Output structured data matching the pull_rates schema. Review output for accuracy. If clean, this becomes the repeatable workflow for full seeding. If not, fall back to hybrid paste-into-Claude method.
14. Seed one test box set end to end (2024 Topps Chrome Baseball — already in schema as example data). Fully populate with real scraped pull rates and real eBay pricing from proof of concept script. Confirm EV, ROI, checklist, format switcher, and price charts all work correctly with real data. If pipeline is solid, proceed to full seed.
15. eBay API full integration (card pricing + box pricing + images from distributor feeds + eBay fallback) — build the full automated pipeline and scheduled refresh now that the proof of concept is validated.
16. Seed database with all sports (Baseball, Football, Basketball, Hockey, Soccer) — 2018-present full profiles, 1995-2017 legacy profiles. Card pricing sourced via eBay API. Pull rates via scraper or hybrid paste workflow.
17. Claude API integration for photo scan feature
18. Buy Now / affiliate link system (UI built, populated when Cam has distributor partnerships)
19. Price alerts and notifications
20. User features (saved boxes, collection tracker, wishlist)
21. Search functionality
22. Pro audit #2 (full-stack dev — is the complete app ready for real users? ~8-15 hours at $50-150/hr = $400-2,250)
23. Beta launch
24. Pro audit #3 (specialist based on what breaks — performance, security, or both. ~5-10 hours at $75-200/hr = $375-2,000)
25. Post-launch: Coming Soon / release calendar, AI trend summaries, portfolio tracking, light/dark mode toggle in settings, Legacy Boxes marketplace tab (if validated)

## Reminders & Flags
- ⚠️ Switch Claude Code to Opus for auth system, database connection layer, and backend API work. Sonnet for all UI and mechanical tasks.
- ⚠️ When we get to database phases: add `circulation_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'unknown'` to `cards` table; add `parent_set_id INT REFERENCES box_sets(id)` to `box_sets` table; add `distributors` and `distributor_listings` tables
- ⚠️ DUMMY_TIER_TREND_DATA bypasses the hook and is consumed inline in BoxProfilePage.jsx — at database phase this needs to move into useBoxProfile, not just be replaced with real data. This is a refactor task, not just a data swap.
- ⚠️ DUMMY_FORMAT_DATA drives formatData in BoxProfilePage.jsx — needs to come from useBoxProfile once parent_set_id is live on box_sets. This is a refactor task, not just a data swap.
- ⚠️ useBoxProfile hook has orphaned MOCK_PULL_RATES data — at database phase, pull rates must return from the hook keyed by format slug so the format switcher can request per-format odds.
- ⚠️ Database phase: flip tier numbering in dir_database_schema.sql and seed data so Tier 1 = Premium Hits and Tier 5 = Base/Rookies. Update sortTiersByValue in checklistUtils.js to sort ascending once schema is corrected. Currently sorts descending as a workaround for the inverted schema.
- ⚠️ Use CSS variables for ALL colors during polish pass — no hardcoded hex values in any new code. Only known exception: CHART_COLORS objects in TierPriceTrendChart.jsx and PriceTrendChart.jsx use hex constants because Recharts passes values directly to SVG attributes where CSS var() doesn't work. Each value has a comment mapping it to its CSS variable.
- ⚠️ Positive financial indicators must stay green (#16a34a via --color-positive) — do not change to purple accent
- ⚠️ Format switcher requires parent_set_id on box_sets — built with dummy data, wire to real data during database phase
- ⚠️ End every polish pass page session with a code audit before committing
- ⚠️ Spreadsheet templates need review with real box data before any data entry begins
- ⚠️ Do not manually enter card prices. Ever. Card pricing comes from the eBay API proof of concept script (post admin panel) and the full eBay API pipeline (Phase 15). Manual eBay lookup card-by-card is not a viable workflow at any scale.
- ⚠️ Pull rate sourcing strategy: try scraper first (targeting Cardboard Connection), fall back to hybrid paste-into-Claude workflow if scraper hits walls. Do not copy-paste and manually organize pull rate tables — too much room for error at scale.
- ⚠️ Do not begin full database seeding until the end-to-end pipeline test with one box set (2024 Topps Chrome Baseball) passes completely. Confirm EV, ROI, checklist, format switcher, and charts all work with real data before committing to full seed.
- ⚠️ Data accuracy before beta does not matter — only Zach and Cam will see the app until the eBay API is live and pricing is automated. Focus on pipeline correctness, not data completeness, during the database build phase.
- ⚠️ iOS app is auth-only — no in-app purchases, no signup flow, no free tier. All acquisition and payment through web/Stripe. Do not deviate without architectural review.
- ⚠️ Payment processor is Stripe (web only). Do not design any iOS purchase flow.

## Development Guidelines
- Use this Project chat for planning, strategy, and decisions
- Use Claude Code for hands-on coding and file creation
- Use Cowork for repetitive data entry processing (test with one box set first)
- Consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase
- One job per file — components render UI, hooks fetch data, utils calculate
- Start each session by reviewing this file and project-brief.md
- Maintain project-brief.md as the living source of truth
- Periodic refactoring to keep things clean
- Frequent GitHub commits with descriptive messages
- If a feature idea comes up that isn't on the plan, flag it — don't build it
- Zach has no dev background — explain everything step by step
